## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY AND ANTIVIRUS WARNING**

Some antivirus software may flag **GhostBruteScanner v1.0** as a potential threat or virus. This is **false positive** behavior, as the application is **completely safe** to use.

The reason for this is that **GhostBruteScanner** uses **.NET protection** and built-in **NuGet packages** to secure the application from crackers and unauthorized tampering. These methods, while enhancing the application's security, may be misinterpreted by antivirus programs as suspicious behavior, which is why they sometimes flag the tool.

Rest assured, the application contains **no viruses or malicious code**. You can safely use it for its intended purpose, but if you experience any antivirus warnings, you can whitelist the tool in your antivirus settings.
